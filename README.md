## Project Overview

The Credit Card Default Prediction project is a machine learning initiative designed to predict whether credit card holders will default on their payments the following month. With the rapid advancements in the financial industry, accurately predicting credit risk has become increasingly important for banks. This project utilizes the characteristics and payment histories of credit card users to forecast the likelihood of default.
